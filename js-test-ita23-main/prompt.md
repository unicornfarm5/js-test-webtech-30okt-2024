Hey ChatGPT :)

I am a computer science lecturer teaching a webdevelopment course in html, css and javascript. I need to create a bunch of programming exercises for a midway test. 

The test should cover syntax aswell as problem solving skills

The test should cover the following learning goals
```
- Programming basics: Variables, types, operators
  - Hello world in javascript
      - `console.log`
  - Variables
      - `const`, `let`
      - Assignment, reassignment
      - Giving variable names
  - Comments
  - Errors
  - Types
      - `number`
      - `string`
      - `boolean`
      - `typeof`

Here is an example of a test where the students have to create a function that adds two numbers:

```
/**
 * This function adds two numbers.
 *
 * @param {number} a - The first number to be added.
 * @param {number} b - The second number to be added.
 * @returns {number} - The sum of the two numbers.
 *
 * Usage:
 * const result = add(2, 3); // result will be 5
 * const anotherResult = add(-1, 1); // anotherResult will be 0
 */
```

Please create 10 exercises. Respond in the same format as the example above using JSdoc
